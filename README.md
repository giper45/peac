## Structure of a prompt

- Instruction A specific task or instruction that guides the model’s behavior and directs it toward the desired output.
- Context External information or additional context that provides background knowledge to the model, helping it generate more accurate and relevant responses. 
- Output indicator Specifies the type or format of the desired output. It helps shape the response by defining whether we need a short answer, a paragraph, or any other specific format.
- Input data The input or question that we want the model to process and provide a response for. It forms the core of the prompt and drives the model’s understanding of the task.
