Database Design Guidelines

1. Normalization
   - First Normal Form (1NF): Atomic values, no repeating groups
   - Second Normal Form (2NF): No partial dependencies
   - Third Normal Form (3NF): No transitive dependencies
   
2. Indexing Strategy
   - Index frequently queried columns
   - Consider composite indexes for multi-column queries
   - Avoid over-indexing (impacts write performance)
   
3. Primary Keys
   - Use surrogate keys (auto-increment or UUID)
   - Never use business data as primary keys
   - Ensure keys are immutable
   
4. Foreign Keys
   - Always define foreign key constraints
   - Use ON DELETE and ON UPDATE clauses appropriately
   - Consider soft deletes for audit trails
   
5. Data Types
   - Choose appropriate data types for columns
   - Use VARCHAR with appropriate lengths
   - Use DECIMAL for monetary values
   - Use DATE/TIMESTAMP for temporal data
   
6. Performance Considerations
   - Denormalize only when necessary for performance
   - Partition large tables
   - Archive old data
   - Regular maintenance (VACUUM, ANALYZE)
   
7. Security
   - Never store passwords in plain text
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement row-level security where needed
   - Regular backups and disaster recovery plans
