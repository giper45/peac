The IEEE conference template in LaTeX provides detailed formatting and style guidelines to ensure consistency across conference papers. Key instructions and tips include:

General Formatting:

Use the IEEEtran class file for consistent formatting, ensuring all margins, column widths, line spacing, and fonts remain as prescribed.
Do not adjust template specifications, as they are designed for uniformity within conference proceedings.
Content Preparation:

Write and finalize content in a separate file before applying IEEE styling. Keep text and graphics files separate until the main text has been fully formatted.
Abbreviations and Acronyms:

Define abbreviations and acronyms at first mention, even if they appear in the abstract, except for universally understood abbreviations (e.g., IEEE, SI).
Avoid using abbreviations in the title or section headings unless necessary.
Units and Measurements:

Use SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units, with English units in parentheses if needed. Avoid mixing SI and CGS units, as this can create confusion.
Maintain consistent notation (e.g., use “0.25” rather than “.25,” and avoid mixing complete spellings and abbreviations in units).
Equations:

Number equations consecutively and use compact formatting where possible (e.g., the solidus /, exp function).
Italicize Roman variables and quantities but not Greek symbols, and use a long dash for minus signs.
Place equation punctuation appropriately and use \eqref for soft cross-references, rather than hard references.
LaTeX-Specific Advice:

Avoid the {eqnarray} environment; use {align} or {IEEEeqnarray} instead to maintain spacing.
Be cautious with the {subequations} environment, as it may affect equation numbering unexpectedly.
Correctly place \label commands within figures and tables to prevent incorrect cross-references.
Common Errors to Avoid:

Grammar and Usage: Treat “data” as plural, avoid common homophone errors (e.g., “affect” vs. “effect”), and use appropriate punctuation inside or outside quotation marks based on context.
Formatting Conventions: Use “non” as a prefix without a hyphen (e.g., “nonlinear”) and avoid redundant expressions like “essentially” when meaning “approximately.”
Capitalization: When “using” in titles can be replaced by “that uses,” capitalize it.
Authors and Affiliations:

List authors from left to right in the sequence desired for future citations, without grouping by affiliation.
Headings and Organizational Hierarchy:

Differentiate between component heads (e.g., “Acknowledgments”) and text heads, which are hierarchical and provide structure to sub-topics.
Maintain at least two sub-topics if using subheads.
Figures and Tables:

Position figures and tables at the tops or bottoms of columns, with captions below figures and heads above tables.
Avoid abbreviations in axis labels to prevent confusion, and use full words (e.g., “Magnetization (A/m)” instead of “M”).
Acknowledgment and References:

For acknowledgments, use “acknowledgment” without an extra “e.” References should follow IEEE citation style, with consecutive numbering in brackets.
Avoid “et al.” unless there are six or more authors, and follow specific punctuation rules for references, including citing unpublished or “in press” papers appropriately.
