# Prompt Engineering Strategies - PEaC Templates

This directory contains YAML templates implementing various prompt engineering strategies using the PEaC (Prompt Engineering as Code) approach.

## Overview

These templates demonstrate how to structure prompts using different prompt engineering techniques, making them modular, reusable, and portable. Each template follows the PEaC structure with `instruction`, `context`, `output`, and `query` sections.

### 2. Input/Output Delimiters (`google-delimiters.yaml`)
- **Strategy**: Clear separation of instructions and content
- **Implementation**: Structured delimiters for complex tasks
- **Use Case**: Multi-part instructions, complex analysis
- **Key Feature**: Systematic processing of delimited sections

### 3. Ask for Missing Information (`google-ask-for-info.yaml`)
- **Strategy**: Request clarification before proceeding
- **Implementation**: Information completeness checking
- **Use Case**: Consultation tasks, requirement gathering
- **Key Feature**: Structured missing information requests

### 4. Task Decomposition (`google-task-decomposition.yaml`)
- **Strategy**: Break complex tasks into subtasks
- **Implementation**: Systematic decomposition process
- **Use Case**: Complex project planning, comprehensive analysis
- **Key Feature**: Logical subtask ordering and execution

### 5. Prompt Chaining (`google-prompt-chaining.yaml`)
- **Strategy**: Sequential prompt execution
- **Implementation**: Multi-step process with dependencies
- **Use Case**: Complex workflows, multi-stage analysis
- **Key Feature**: Output from previous steps informs next steps

## Usage Instructions

1. **Choose a Strategy**: Select the template that matches your use case
2. **Customize Content**: Modify the sections according to your needs
3. **Add Supporting Files**: Create necessary context or example files
4. **Run with PEaC**: Use `poetry run peac prompt <template.yaml>`
5. **Iterate and Refine**: Adjust based on results

## Best Practices

1. **Modular Design**: Keep instructions, context, and output formatting separate
2. **Clear Objectives**: Define specific goals in the instruction section
3. **Rich Context**: Provide relevant background information
4. **Structured Output**: Specify clear formatting requirements
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Test and improve prompts based on results

### PEaC Prompt Engineering Strategy Implementation

This work presents a comprehensive implementation of prompt engineering strategies using the PEaC (Prompt Engineering as Code) framework. We have developed a collection of 12 YAML-based templates that systematically implement established prompt engineering methodologies, making them modular, reusable, and empirically comparable.

**Strategy Coverage and Implementation:**

*Learning-Based Approaches:* We implemented Few-Shot Prompting (Ahmed et al., 2023) using PEaC's local file import mechanism to systematically incorporate training examples from external text files. Our Zero-Shot Prompting template (Kojima et al., 2022) demonstrates pure instruction-based task execution without example dependency.

*Reasoning-Enhanced Methods:* Chain-of-Thought prompting (Diao et al., 2023) is implemented through PEaC's modular structure, breaking complex reasoning into discrete, trackable steps. The ReAc (Reasoning and Acting) methodology (Yang et al., 2023) is structured as a two-phase template combining analytical reasoning with actionable implementation planning.

*Context-Aware Strategies:* Contextual Prompting (Liu et al., 2023) leverages PEaC's context section to systematically incorporate domain-specific knowledge from external files. Dynamic Prompting (Wang et al., 2022) utilizes parameterized YAML templates that enable runtime modification of prompt behavior through variable substitution.

*Advanced Composition Techniques:* Drawing from Google's Prompt Engineering Handbook, we implemented Persona Assignment for role-based expertise simulation, Task Decomposition for systematic complexity management, and Prompt Chaining for sequential reasoning workflows. Input/Output Delimiters provide structured parsing of multi-component instructions.

**Framework Advantages:**

The PEaC implementation offers several methodological benefits: (1) **Reproducibility** - YAML templates ensure consistent prompt structure across experiments; (2) **Modularity** - Strategies can be combined through template inheritance and composition; (3) **Empirical Comparison** - Standardized structure enables systematic A/B testing of prompt variations; (4) **Version Control** - Templates can be tracked, branched, and merged using standard Git workflows; (5) **Scalability** - External file imports support large-scale context integration without template modification.

**Validation and Testing:**

Each template includes concrete examples demonstrating practical application. Supporting files provide realistic datasets for few-shot learning scenarios (sentiment analysis, mathematical reasoning, code classification) and contextual information for domain-specific applications. The modular architecture enables researchers to isolate individual strategy effects while maintaining experimental control.

This implementation bridges the gap between prompt engineering theory and practical application, providing researchers with a standardized toolkit for systematic prompt engineering experimentation and deployment.
